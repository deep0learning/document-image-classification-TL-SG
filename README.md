This page is published with intention to provide region based pre-trained models for document image classification for document structure learning. For using weight matrices, please note that we used theano as the backend for all our experiments hence everything is ordered per theano's style.<Enter>

# Dataset
[RVL-CDIP](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aharley/rvl-cdip/) has been used to validate the proposed methodology. This dataset consists of 400000 scanned grayscale images distributed among 16 categories. Also this collection is subdivided into training, validation and test sets each containing 320000, 40000 and 40000 images respectively.

# Pre-trained Models
Trained models in this publication have been made available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oFk0eytDn_M6LmdugI22JUV4nmnO5gIv). Please note that all weight matrices are formatted with theano as a background and not tensorflow. That also includes theano style input dimension ordering.
